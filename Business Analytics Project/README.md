📊 **Minute Mapping System – Excel Template**

🧾 **Purpose**

These files maps VoIP call data (CDRs) to carriers based on IP addresses. It calculates the total minutes done by each carrier, providing accurate data for billing and reporting.

📂 **Files Included**

**1. IP File (Working File 1)**

**Sheet 1:** List of carriers and their corresponding IPs.

**Sheet 2:** Paste the raw CDR data.

**Functionality:** Uses Excel formulas (such as SUMIF) to calculate total minutes per IP.


**2. Minute Mapping Dashboard (Working File 2)**
**Sheet "H":** Displays daily totals, weekly summaries (W1–W5), and final comparison.
**Sheets W1–W5:** Weekly summary sheets.
**Sheets 1–31:** Daily data entry for each day of the month.

**3. Sample CDR File**
A test file with dummy data to help you understand the workflow.

🔄 **How It Works (Data Flow)**

* Paste the CDR data into Sheet 2 of the IP File.
* Based on the IP mapping, total minutes per carrier are calculated automatically.
* Copy the daily totals into the corresponding day sheet (1–31) in the Dashboard.

**The Dashboard automatically updates:**
✅ Daily totals
✅ Weekly summaries
✅ Monthly comparison table to catch mismatches

🛠️ **What You Need To Do**
**Step 1:** Paste CDR data → IP File (Sheet 2)
**Step 2:** Copy mapped minutes → Dashboard (correct daily sheet)

✅ **Final Output**

* Total minutes per carrier (daily, weekly, and monthly)
* Final cross-check table for error detection
* Clean and structured dashboard for Finance, Operations, or Management review

📁 **Designed for internal use in IPRN/VoIP call environments to streamline traffic analysis and billing accuracy.**
