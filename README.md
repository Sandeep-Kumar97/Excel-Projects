Hi, I'm Sandeep ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Operations and Data Executive with a strong focus on accuracy, efficiency, and process improvement. My experience spans handling large volumes of data, managing CRM platforms like HubSpot, and supporting cross-functional teams with timely, reliable insights.

Over time, Iâ€™ve worked closely with sales and support teams to ensure smooth back-end operations â€” from maintaining lakhs of records with precision to creating systems that enhance visibility and accountability across departments.

On this GitHub, youâ€™ll find a few of my projects and tools that Iâ€™ve either built or contributed to â€” mainly around data cleaning, automated Excel trackers, and task management workflows.

In my career, Iâ€™ve:

Managed and updated databases with lakhs of entries, ensuring zero data loss and consistency.

Worked extensively on HubSpot CRM, helping teams track leads, resolve queries, and maintain communication logs.

Created automated templates and dashboards in Excel to simplify daily reporting and reduce manual effort.

Played a key role in team onboarding and training for CRM adoption and operational tools.
